# Resources

- [Digital Accessibility Toolkit](https://a11y.canada.ca/en/) is an on-going, open source page made by public servants for public servants. It is under construction so there may not be as many resources as desired.
- [Colour contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) will help you check if your text colours work with your background colour. You'll need the hex code of the colour. There are [many tools](https://colors-picker.com/hex-color-picker/) you can use if you need to convert your colours into hex code. 
    - You can use [FireFox eyedropper tool](https://techplugged.com/how-to-use-the-eyedropper-tool-on-the-firefox-browser-to-detect-colours/) to extract the colours from websites.
